This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous 
classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, 
compared to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data 
sets. We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with 
non-adaptive active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that..We conclude that.

   An increase in angle of attack of a planes’ wing results in an increase in both lift and induced drag (skybrary.aero, n.d.). If the angle of attack is too steep, the airflow across the upper surface of the aerofoil gets disconnected. This results in the airflow around the wing not being laminar (Al Bowers, 2011) resulting in a loss of lift, also known as stalling. The angle at which relative wind strikes an aerofoil is known as the angle of attack. The relative velocity between the aeroplane and the atmosphere is represented by the angle created by the aerofoil's chord and the relative wind direction (skybrary.aero, n.d.). By finding ways to increase the angle of attack, we can reduce the time taken for take-off and landing which would reduce the fuel consumption as a huge amount of fuel is needed for that part of the journey.
