<pre>

Angle of attack (AOA) is a critical component that affects lift, drag, and the overall performance of the aircraft in flight dynamics. This
essay explains the importance of angle of attack (AOA) in aviation, including how it contributes to lift production, the dangers of stalling 
because of excessive AOA, and the techniques used in aircraft design to control AOA, like the use of flaps and slats. Planes try to minimize 
fuel consumption and their impact on the environment by maximizing efficiency during takeoff, landing, and cruising by adjusting their angle 
of attack (AOA). This conversation emphasizes how vitally important AOA management is to improved flight capability and sustainability in 
contemporary aviation.

  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

    <p class= "ex1">
      <pre>
An increase in angle of attack of a planes’ wings results in an increase in both lift and induced drag (skybrary.aero, n.d.). If the angle of 
attack is too steep, the airflow across the upper surface of the aerofoil gets disconnected. This results in the airflow around the wing not 
being laminar (Al Bowers, 2011) resulting in a loss of lift, also known as stalling. The angle at which relative wind strikes an aerofoil is 
known as the angle of attack. The relative velocity between the aeroplane and the atmosphere is represented by the angle created by the 
aerofoil's chord and the relative wind direction (skybrary.aero, n.d.). By finding ways to maximise the angle of attack, we can reduce the
time taken for take-off and landing which would reduce the fuel consumption as a huge amount of fuel is needed for that part of the journey.

Over time, the design of planes’ wings have changed to increase lift and reduce the amount of thrust needed for flight. This is done by making 
the air on top of the wing move faster than the bottom (SIMSCALE, 2023). This is why the wings’ top surface is curved and the bottom is flat.
Having a greater velocity of air on the top than the bottom creates a low pressure zone on top of the wing and a greater pressure on the bottom 
(The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2017). In order to create and even greater angle the wing itself is tilted which allows for
the plane to have maximum upthrust whilst burning a minute amount of fuel.

 The angle of attack of an aerofoil can be visualized by looking at the aerofoil’s cross section and the direction of oncoming wind during flight.

A plane's angle of attack has several implications. While increasing the angle of attack results in increased lift, it also makes aeroplanes more
susceptible to stalling. Lift creation is primarily a result of the difference in air pressure above and below the wings of an aircraft. As air flows
over the wing's curved upper surface (with a higher camber) and the flatter lower surface, it encounters different distances to travel in the same 
amount of time (Bernoulli's principle). This variation in distance leads to a difference in airspeed: the air on top travels faster than the air 
beneath the wing. Stalls occur when an aeroplane fails to generate adequate lift due to a critical angle of attack (when the angle of attack is 
greater than the maximum angle of attack). Air will flow easily over the plane's wings, and if there is insufficient lift, i.e. the weight due to
gravity is greater than the lift, the plane will fall from the sky.

From figure two we can assume the same forces also affect the aerofoil (similar to figure 1) if we link this to the theory of flight which states: 
Four physical forces must be carefully balanced in order for heavier-than-air flight to be possible: lift, drag, weight and thrust. 
(MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1997). We can momentarily alter the wing's shape and angle of attack by using flaps and slacks. 
Flaps and slats are aerodynamic devices built into aircraft wings that serve to change and control the angle of attack (AOA) during various phases 
of flight. These tools are essential for improving aerodynamic performance because they provide more lift, better control, and fuel efficiency. The
chord line shifts as the flaps descend and the trailing edge moves. This results in an increase in the wing's size and angle of attack. 
(MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1997). This allows planes to be more fuel efficient thus being more economical for the airlines as 
well as more environmentally friendly.

     <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

    <p class= "ex1">
      <pre>

The angle of attack (AOA) serves as a critical determinant in aviation, governing the balance between lift and drag crucial for flight. While 
increasing AOA enhances lift, it simultaneously heightens the risk of stalling when surpassing a critical threshold. Understanding the intricate 
relationship between AOA, airflow, and wing design allows for innovations in aviation technology, such as adjustable flaps and slats, enabling planes
to optimize AOA for improved fuel efficiency and environmental impact. Effectively managing AOA remains pivotal in advancing aircraft design, enhancing 
flight performance, and reducing operational costs.
